        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code using classes and objects to model real-world entities It allows for code that's more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a blueprint or template for creating objects, It defines the data and functions that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Think of a class like an architectural blueprint for a house it defines what a house should have like doors, windows, rooms but it's not an actual house. You can create multiple houses (objects) based on that blueprint, each with its own values.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - An object in Oop is an instance of a class, It's a concrete entity that is created based on the blueprint provided by a class. While the class defines the structure and behavior, the object holds actual data and can use the methods defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and Encapsulation is the methods that operate on that data within one class, and restricting direct access to some of the object’s components.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, in Python are special reserved methods that are surrounded by double underscores. These methods allow you to define how instances of your classes behave when they are used with built-in Python functions or operators. Understanding dunder methods is crucial for creating custom objects that behave like built-in types or implementing operator overloading in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "  - Inheritance is an OOP concept where one class (called the child or subclass) inherits properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (called the parent or superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "  - This allows for code reuse and a natural way to model real-world relationships (like a Car is a type of Vehicle)."

The overridden method in the subclass must have the same name, parameters, and return type as the one in the superclass. This enables the subclass to customize or extend the inherited method's behavior. When called on a subclass object, the subclass version is executed at runtime, not the superclass version. This supports polymorphism through dynamic method dispatch based on the object's actual type."

        "  - Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line, one after another, like a chain. This is possible when each method returns self (i.e., the object itself), allowing the next method to be called on that object.\n",

        "  - The __call__ method in Python is one of the special methods, and it allows an instance of a class to be called like a function.\n",
